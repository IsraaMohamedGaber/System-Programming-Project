# 📘 System Programming Project – Language with Exactly One Double Letter

## 📚 Description

This project implements a computational system for the language:  
**L = {w ∈ Σ\* | w contains exactly one double letter}**

A *double letter* means two consecutive identical letters.  
Examples:
- ✅ `baaba` → Valid (only one double letter: `aa`)
- ❌ `baaaba` → Invalid (two double letters: `aa`, `aa`)

We perform the following tasks:
1. Define a regular expression for the language.
2. Construct an NFA from the regular expression and implement it.
3. Convert the NFA to a DFA and implement it.
4. Design a context-free grammar (CFG) for the same language and implement a parser.
5. Test all implementations with multiple input strings to validate correctness.
